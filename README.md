## App Idea:
  I want to create an app that syncs calorie tracking, workouts, and gym habits all into one. 
  Most fitness apps are separated in that regard, most don't have all of what takes to build a great body into one.
  My idea is to build an app that defeats this problem. The features I would like to implement are having separate sections for this app.
  One section will be a page in which a user can select workout templates like Push, Pull, and Legs, and a small subsection for a list of all weightlifting and
  bodyweight exercises. 

  The second section will host a healthy meal tracker, which can read barcodes for food a user eats and count calories for said food. The user
  can use this section to count their metabolic rate and use that to determine their health goals. A separate section can hold recommendations for the user based 
  on their workout choices and food choices. 

   The final main section will be a health tracker connecting everything. It will be a tracker to remind a user to work for x amount of times a week, 
  achieve a daily calorie goal x times a week, sleep x times a week, and anything else that will get them to their fitness goals.

  In conclusion, I wish to construct a fitness app that brings all the aspects of fitness into one.
